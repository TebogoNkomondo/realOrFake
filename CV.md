\begin{rSection}{Projects} 

\begin{rSubsection}{Trip-Planner Application}{15 April 2019 - 11 May 2019}{Web Development}{}
The project is a web-app based trip-planning application with features that include secure user registrations and personal profiles with different privelleges, event schedule, group planned trips and a map interface for easy navigation during trips. It was developed by a team of 5 Software Development 3 students at Wits University with a strong emphasis on Agile methodology. The scrum approach was taken and the project was divided into 4 sprints which were done in 4 weeks 
Tools and software used: Javascript, HTML5, Bootstrap 4, MySQL, MapBox API, AJAX, Travis, Trello
Responsibilities included: Setting up a user a MySQL database, Created a user-registration and login system with password hashing for increased security(Using Sequelize), A system for trip creation and maintanance by users, and front-end for user-dashboard upon loging onto the web-app.
\end{rSubsection}


\begin{rSubsection}{Indexing XML Hansards}{April 2020 - May 2020}{Data Intensive Computing in Datascience}{}
The project was taken to index transcribed records of debates in the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa(Hansards). The Hansards dataset is large, hence non-cached search algorithms are extremely slow. Due to its excellent time performance for search and insert operations a Hash Table was chosen to be the method of indexing. To further improve the indexing of all the data within the dataset MPI4Py was used to perform all insertion into the HashTable. A search function which searches the HashTable for different debate participants and the different debates in which they participate was then developed.
Tools and software used: Python, MPI4PY (Message Passing Interface(MPI)), MRJob(Map Reduce)
